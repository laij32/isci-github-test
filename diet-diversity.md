   - ii.	The Great Barrier Reef contains too great of a genetic diversity to be severely impacted by climate change, human intervention is unlikely to produce significant change and may instead cause greater damage. 
   - iii.	Many media outlets claim that the damage humans have done to the Great Barrier Reef is nearly irreversible and that changes need to be implemented immediately; it is interesting how this author refutes the need for intervention.

   - ii.	The increased amount of human-caused CO2 emissions into Earth’s oceans have caused increased ocean acidification, negatively affecting the biodiversity of marine algal communities.
   - iii.	This claim prompted me to rethink how much climate change has impacted the marine environment, especially in relation to the increasing amounts of CO2 emissions that are currently being absorbed by the oceanic waters.

   - ii.	The increasing amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide that is absorbed into the ocean causes pteropods to build thinner shells, negatively impacting their survivability. 
   - iii.	This article made me question the extent to which marine organisms and various biota suffer due to human related consequences of burning fossil fuels.

   - ii.	The drastic decrease in salinity in the oceans has caused patchy and raised skin lesions to develop on the bodies of dolphins. 
   - iii.	This news article made me question whether humans, climate change activist groups, and the government are doing enough to protect the vulnerable fauna and flora groups under the ocean since these skin diseases seem to be a unique phenomenon.
   
3. Evaluation Claim that Global Warming Will Affect Children's Nutrition

Eric Worrall argues that a recent scientific paper published by Niles et al. (2021) is flawed because it does not put more emphasis on its most significant result, wealth. He highlights an online newspaper article written by Sonia Elks, who spends most of the space describing the detrimental impact of climate change on children’s diet diversity (Elks, 2021). He specifically points out that she states household wealth as the biggest single predictor of diet variety, a point mirrored in the published research article which is not described in significant detail (Worrall, 2021). Worrall is critical that little emphasis is placed on poverty, even though poverty was not the purpose of the scientific study. He concludes his opinion piece by stating that Africa should mirror the actions of China by coal guzzling to alleviate itself from poverty (Worrall, 2021). This article is of particular interest due to his reasoning in questioning the normal scientific method procedure. In essence, although Worrall brings up a great point in stating the socioeconomic conditions that limit the quality of life for certain individuals in poorer areas, the research aimed to primarily investigate the potential impacts of climate change. It is also important to outline and bring awareness to issues such as malnutrition since this is a growing concern in many areas of the world. Since climate change appears to add to this problem, it is integral for this research to be published as a way of communicating the imminent message to aid vulnerable groups quickly. 

Despite the opinion stated by Eric Worrall, the detrimental influence of climate change certainly has an impact on diet diversity in children. Firstly, he cited a peer-reviewed journal article within the Environmental Research Letters, a credible source for environmental science papers. Meredith Niles and Molly Brown, the principal investigators for this study, are also both credible researchers listed on the orcid.org website (Niles et al., 2021). The purpose of their scientific journal is to investigate the relationship of climate change and diet diversity across children in nineteen countries (Niles et al., 2021). Although they do state that wealth is the biggest predictor of reduced diet diversity as mentioned in the newspaper article, it is not the main point of article. Rather, they acknowledge the socioeconomic limitations associated with their study and use wealth as one example of a comparative factor to the other variables selected. Niles et al. (2021) also do a thorough job within the study to ensure that their results are transparent, reproducible, and easy to follow. Their methodology is concisely and clearly explained. They analyze and discuss case studies alongside regional and international models to prove the effect of climate change on diet diversity, further validating their data results. 
  
Furthermore, many other studies support and provided basis for the research conducted by Niles et al. (2021). For example, one study provided the basis for research for stating that climate change will be most pronounced in areas in the global South, where the areas are hot and dry (Fanzo et al., 2018). Another source confirms that climate change directly affects food production systems, alongside the socioeconomic forces which can be evaluated separately (Myers et al., 2017). In addition, one scientific journal has made it clear that not enough efforts are being taken to reverse the effects of climate change on undernutrition (Phalkey et al., 2015). Thus, although Worrall’s point is correct that wealth may be the biggest determining factor, climate change can certainly be studied as a variable separate from socioeconomic status. The vast amount of literature present against Worrall’s point prove that climate change plays a significant role in the diet diversity of children.  

4. Reflection

Overall, one of the common themes I noticed involved the logical fallacy of hasty generalization. Similar to the article written by Eric Worrall, many articles primarily base their entire point on one aspect of a scientific article, without doing their due diligence to research other related papers. If Worrall had done his research, he would have discovered that the scientific papers were not undermining wealth and socioeconomic status as a major contributor to the lack of diet diversity in children, but rather supporting the argument of the current crisis around the globe. In addition, many of the news articles tend to exaggerate their point, even if they have correctly identified the main point from the research article cited. This causes their readers to misunderstand the point that is being constructed since a short news article is likely more appealing to the public than a scientific paper.
